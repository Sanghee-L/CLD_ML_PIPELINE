# CLD-ML-Pipeline

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a machine-learning-ready data architecture
for Cell Line Development (CLD) using synthetic data.

## Current Status
🚧 Under active development.

Currently included:
- ML-optimized ERD for CLD<img width="5664" height="2406" alt="ERdiagram_for_CLD_v3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38fbed57-0474-48c4-9857-bfb6c50c8859" />
- SQLite database schema

## Planned Features
- Synthetic CLD data generation
- Feature engineering for clone-level ML
- Early productivity drop clone screening
- Stability prediction models (stable or not stable) which apply for fet-batch or perfusion process
