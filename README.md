# CLD-ML-Pipeline

Simulation-driven clone selection framework for Cell Line Development (CLD)

---

## 🚀 Vision

Cell Line Development (CLD) is one of the most time and cost-intensive stages in biologics manufacturing.

While AI has advanced drug discovery, predictive modeling for **biomanufacturing platforms** remains underdeveloped.

This project aims to build a **Simulation-Driven Laboratory (SDL) framework for CLD**, enabling:

- Early-stage clone ranking  
- Late-stage outcome prediction  
- Multi-objective decision modeling  
- Platform engineering scenario simulation  

The long-term goal is to reduce CLD time, cost, and experimental burden using predictive modeling.

---

## Concept

We simulate a realistic CLD process including:
```
	•	Clone-to-clone productivity variability (log-normal)
	•	Stability-driven productivity decay
	•	Expression burden effects
	•	Stress accumulation
	•	Aggregation (quality proxy)
	•	Batch effects
	•	Culture mode differences (fed-batch vs perfusion)
	•	Copy number (ddPCR-like)
	•	Platform factor (targeted integration vs legacy)
	•	Clone-specific decay heterogeneity
```

The framework allows:

Early data (passages 3–10) → Late prediction (passages 24–30)

## Synthetic Data Generator

The generator simulates:

**Latent variables per clone:**
```
	•	Productivity (P)
	•	Stability (S)
	•	Quality potential (Q)
	•	Platform factor (G)
	•	Copy number (CN)
	•	Clone-specific decay sensitivity (k_decay_i)
```
**Assays:**
```	•	Titer
	•	VCD
	•	Viability
	•	Aggregation
	•	ddPCR copy number
```
**Derived label:**
	•	Productivity drop % (early vs late)

The generator supports scenario switches:
```
enable_platform=True
enable_copy_number=True
enable_clone_decay_variation=True
```
This allows ablation and sensitivity analysis.

## 📈 Modeling Strategy

We train 3 regression models:
```
	1.	Stability drop
	2.	Late-stage titer
	3.	Late-stage aggregation
```
Evaluation includes:
```
	•	R²
	•	MAE
	•	Spearman rank correlation
	•	Top-K overlap
	•	Top-K enrichment rate
```
---

## 🎯 Multi-Objective Selection

We simulate commercial clone selection using:
```
Utility = a*z(late_titer)
        - b*z(drop)
        - c*z(late_aggregation)
```
We evaluate:
```
	•	Top 5 / 10 / 20 retention
	•	True-good recall
	•	Ranking robustness
```

---

## Platform Scenario Modeling

The framework supports comparison between:
```
	•	Legacy random integration
	•	Targeted integration platform
	•	High-copy unstable clones
	•	Optimized secretion pathway
```
This allows:

Testing whether platform engineering improves early predictability.

---

## Scientific Foundations

This work is informed by:
```
	•	Reinhart et al., Biotechnol J (2018)
	•	Lakshmanan et al., Biotechnol Bioeng (2019)
```
Multi-omics evidence shows host-specific behavior and complex regulation of productivity and quality.

---

## Key Insight

Early → Late prediction is inherently difficult due to:
```
	•	Epigenetic silencing
	•	Stress accumulation
	•	Secretion bottlenecks
	•	Platform effects
	•	Stochastic events
```
Therefore, the goal is not perfect prediction, but:

Enrichment improvement under uncertainty.

---

## Future Directions
	•	Multi-omics integration
	•	Glycosylation modeling
	•	Secretory capacity modeling
	•	Platform upgrade simulation
	•	Automated weight tuning (policy optimization)
	•	Real CLD dataset validation
	•	Robotic integration

---

## Current Status
```
✔ Synthetic CLD simulator
✔ Multi-target ML modeling
✔ Ranking evaluation framework
✔ Platform scenario switches
✔ Copy number integration
✔ Decision simulation engine
```
Ongoing work:
```
	•	Improve early → late signal strength
	•	Platform scenario (traditional (random integration) vs optimized (targeted insertion) calibration)
	•	Advanced ranking metrics
```
