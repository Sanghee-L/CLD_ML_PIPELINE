# CLD-ML-Pipeline

Simulation-driven clone selection framework for Cell Line Development (CLD)

Vision

Cell Line Development (CLD) remains one of the most resource-intensive stages in biologics manufacturing.
Despite advances in AI for drug discovery, predictive modeling for biomanufacturing platforms is still underdeveloped.

This project aims to build a Simulation-Driven Laboratory (SDL) framework for CLD, enabling:
	•	Early-stage clone ranking
	•	Late-stage outcome prediction
	•	Multi-objective decision simulation
	•	Platform engineering scenario testing

The long-term goal is to reduce CLD time, cost, and experimental burden using predictive modeling.

## Current Status
🚧 Under active development.

Currently included:
- ML-optimized ERD for CLD ![CLD ERD](ERD/ERdiagram_for_CLD_v3.png)
- SQLite database schema
- Synthetic CLD data generation

## Planned Features
- Feature engineering for clone-level ML
- Early productivity drop clone screening
- Stability prediction models (stable or not stable) which apply for fet-batch or perfusion process
