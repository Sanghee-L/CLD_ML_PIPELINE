# CLD-ML-Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates a machine-learning-ready data architecture
and end-to-end pipeline for Cell Line Development (CLD) using synthetic data.

## Key Features
- ML-optimized ERD for CLD
- Synthetic multi-level CLD data generation
- Early clone drop decision modeling
- Stability prediction using early data
- Batch-aware ML pipeline

## ERD Design

## Synthetic Data Generation
- Latent biological factors
- Batch effects
- Process condition effects

## ML Tasks
1. Early clone drop classification
2. Stability regression
3. Decision impact simulation

## Why This Matters
- Reduces CLD time and cost
- Demonstrates ML-aware data design
- Applicable to real-world biopharma CLD
